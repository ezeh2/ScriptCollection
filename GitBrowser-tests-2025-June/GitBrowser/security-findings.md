# Security Assessment Findings

This document summarizes the security assessment of the GitBrowser application.

## Vulnerability Analysis:

### 1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
- The application uses ASP.NET Core MVC's Razor view engine, which provides automatic output encoding, mitigating XSS risks from data like repository names or commit messages.

### 2. Path Traversal:
- The `GitService.IsValidRepoPath` method validates that repository paths are within the configured `RootPath`. It normalizes paths and uses `StartsWith` to prevent access to directories outside this root. This effectively mitigates path traversal vulnerabilities.

### 3. Command Injection:
- The application uses the `LibGit2Sharp` library for Git operations. This library interacts with Git repositories via its C API, not by shelling out to `git` command-line executables. This design prevents command injection vulnerabilities.

## Other Security Checks:

### 1. Dependency Review:
- Checked `LibGit2Sharp 0.31.0` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation 8.0.17` using the Snyk vulnerability database.
- No known direct vulnerabilities were found for these versions at the time of the review.

### 2. Hardcoded Secrets:
- Reviewed `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
- No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, connection strings) were found. The `RootPath` setting is a local file path configuration, not a secret.

### 3. Error Handling:
- Error handling in `GitController` and `GitService` is generally robust.
- The application returns generic error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., BadRequest, NotFound) to the client, avoiding leakage of sensitive exception details.
- Service-level exceptions (e.g., `UnauthorizedAccessException` during directory traversal) are caught and handled gracefully (e.g., by skipping problematic resources).

### 4. Authentication and Authorization:
- The application does not implement any explicit user authentication or authorization mechanisms.
- Access control relies solely on:
    - The security of the machine hosting the application.
    - The `RootPath` configuration in `appsettings.json`, which limits the scope of browsable repositories.
- This is acceptable if the application is strictly for local, single-user use. However, if deployed in a shared or networked environment, this lack of authentication would be a critical vulnerability.

## Recommendations:

- **Configuration**: Ensure the `RootPath` in `appsettings.json` is configured carefully to include only intended repositories, especially if the application could be accessed by others.
- **Deployment**: If the application is ever considered for deployment beyond a local, single-user machine, strong authentication and authorization mechanisms must be implemented.

## Overall Security Posture:

For its apparent intended use as a local Git browsing utility, the application demonstrates good practices in preventing common web vulnerabilities like XSS, path traversal, and command injection. The primary security consideration is the environment in which it is deployed and the scope of the `RootPath` configuration due to the absence of authentication.
