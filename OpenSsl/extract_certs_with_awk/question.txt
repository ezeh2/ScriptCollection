
I would like to get all certificates of the certicate chain of a http-site.
Using openssl I connect to the http-site and store output to file **out.txt**:

    openssl s_client -connect www.openssl.org:443 -showcerts > out.txt
	
The content of **out.txt** looks like below. It contains two certificates:
```
...
 0 s:CN = www.openssl.org
   i:C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = Let's Encrypt Authority X3
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIFVTCCBD2gAwIBAgISAwk9QUiwVmoQAtcCLKybaK7yMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUA
...
mQBom1EISBOiNyu5koR6iRZcXsn6x/4kwA==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
 1 s:C = US, O = Let's Encrypt, CN = Let's Encrypt Authority X3
   i:O = Digital Signature Trust Co., CN = DST Root CA X3
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIEkjCCA3qgAwIBAgIQCgFBQgAAAVOFc2oLheynCDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADA/
...
KOqkqm57TH2H3eDJAkSnh6/DNFu0Qg==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
---
...
```
Now I want to store every certificate in a file ending with extension **.cer**.
For the above example the files **Let's Encrypt Authority X3.cer** and **www.openssl.org.cer** should be created. 

Using command **openssl x509** I was only able to store first certifcate contained in **out.txt**.

    cat out.txt | openssl x509 > www.openssl.org.cer

But I want to store all *certifcates* contained in **out.txt** not just the first one.

Can this be done with **openssl** somehow ? Or with **awk** ?
